00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.160
Let's learn about how

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.310
IP addresses are used to
communicate over a network.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.905
IP stands for internet protocol.

4
00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.460
An internet protocol
address, or IP address, is

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.680
a unique string of
characters that identifies

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.275
a location of a
device on the internet.

7
00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:19.515
Each device on the internet
has a unique IP address,

8
00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.180
just like every
house on a street

9
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.440
has its own mailing address.

10
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.345
There are two types
of IP addresses:

11
00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:29.420
IP version 4, or IPv4,

12
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.855
and IP version 6, or IPv6.

13
00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:36.085
Let's look at examples
of an IPv4 address.

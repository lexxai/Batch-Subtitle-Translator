00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.160
Let's learn about how

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.310
IP addresses are used to
communicate over a network.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.905
IP stands for internet protocol.

4
00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.460
An internet protocol
address, or IP address, is

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.680
a unique string of
characters that identifies

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.275
a location of a
device on the internet.

7
00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:19.515
Each device on the internet
has a unique IP address,

8
00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.180
just like every
house on a street

9
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.440
has its own mailing address.

10
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.345
There are two types
of IP addresses:

11
00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:29.420
IP version 4, or IPv4,

12
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.855
and IP version 6, or IPv6.

13
00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:36.085
Let's look at examples
of an IPv4 address.

14
00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:39.090
IPv4 addresses are
written as four, 1,

15
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.875
2, or 3-digit numbers
separated by a decimal point.

16
00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.230
In the early days
of the internet,

17
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.520
IP addresses were all

18
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.550
IPV4. But as the use
of the internet grew,

19
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.680
all the IPv4 addresses
started to get

20
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.475
used up, so IPv6 was developed.

21
00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.280
IPv6 addresses are made
up of 32 characters.

22
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.380
The length of the IPv6 address

23
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.090
will allow for more
devices to be connected

24
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.860
to the internet
without running out of

25
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.840
addresses as quickly as IPv4.

26
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.605
IP addresses can be
either public or private.

27
00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:11.900
Your internet service
provider assigns

28
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.310
a public IP address that is

29
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.545
connected to your
geographic location.

30
00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.420
When network communications goes

31
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.100
out from your device
on the internet,

32
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.950
they all have the same
public-facing address.

33
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.570
Just like all the roommates in

34
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.790
one home share the
same mailing address,

35
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.980
all the devices on
a network share

36
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.350
the same public-facing
IP address.

37
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.810
Private IP addresses
are only seen

38
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.600
by other devices on the
same local network.

39
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.370
This means that
all the devices on

40
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.170
your home network can
communicate with each other

41
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.910
using unique IP addresses

42
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.190
that the rest of the
internet can't see.

43
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.900
Another kind of address used in

44
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.390
network communications
is called a MAC address.

45
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.740
A MAC address is

46
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.780
a unique alphanumeric
identifier that is

47
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.255
assigned to each physical
device on a network.

48
00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:55.400
When a switch receives
a data packet,

49
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.020
it reads the MAC address of

50
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.110
the destination device
and maps it to a port.

51
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.515
It then keeps this information
in a MAC address table.

52
00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.270
Think of the MAC address table

53
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.650
like an address book
that the switch

54
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.500
uses to direct data packets
to the appropriate device.

55
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.960
In this video, you learned about

56
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.155
IP version 4 and IP
version 6 addresses.

57
00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:17.870
You learned how IP and MAC
addresses are used in

58
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.670
network communication
and the difference

59
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.100
between a public and
a private IP address.
